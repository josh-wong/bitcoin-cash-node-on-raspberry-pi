# Cleaning up old files

Let's clean up our SSD since we no longer need the files from our previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation. 

> **Note**
> 
> This part is optional but recommended.

To remove those old files, open a new **Terminal** window and run the following command. Be sure to:

- Replace **<SSD-DIRECTORY\>** with the name of the SSD directory.
- Replace **<OLD-VERSION-NUMBER\>** with the version number of the previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation.

`sudo rm -R /<SSD-DIRECTORY>/bitcoin-cash-node-<OLD-VERSION-NUMBER>`

With the SSD organized, we can avoid confusion when updating Bitcoin Cash Node in the future.
