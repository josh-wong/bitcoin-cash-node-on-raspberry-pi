# Clean up old files

You should clean up your SSD since you no longer need the files from your previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation.

:::note

This part is optional but recommended.

:::

To remove those old files, open a new **Terminal** window and run the following command. Be sure to:

- Replace `<SSD_DIRECTORY>` with the name of the SSD directory.
- Replace `<OLD_VERSION_NUMBER>` with the version number of the previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation.

```console
sudo rm -R /<SSD_DIRECTORY>/bitcoin-cash-node-<OLD_VERSION_NUMBER>
```

With the SSD organized, you can avoid confusion when updating Bitcoin Cash Node in the future.
