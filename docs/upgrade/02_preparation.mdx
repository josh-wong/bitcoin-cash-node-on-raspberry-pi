# Prepare your device

Before upgrading Bitcoin Cash Node, you should back up your wallet (in the .dat file format) and update your device. This will help ensure a smooth upgrade process.

## Optional: Back up your Bitcoin Cash wallet

:::warning

This step is optional since you will be moving your blockchain data, which includes your wallet, from the old Bitcoin Cash Node directory into a new directory. However, temporarily backing up your wallet is still recommended just in case you encounter an issue during the upgrade.

:::

In the **Bitcoin Cash Node application**, click **File** and choose **Back up wallet**.

Then, choose a directory to save your wallet backup.

Your wallet will be saved in the directory you chose. You'll be moving this wallet file to the newer version of Bitcoin Cash Node later, so remember where you saved this wallet backup file.

## Update and upgrade Ubuntu Desktop

Before you start the upgrade process, you should exit from Bitcoin Cash Node and install any updates and upgrades to Ubuntu Desktop.

To close Bitcoin Cash Node, do one of the following:

- **To close the application from the graphical user interface (GUI):** Click **File**, then choose **Exit**.

Now, update and upgrade Ubuntu Desktop by running the following command in Terminal.

```console
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Since you might have installed major updates and upgrades, reboot the device by running the following command in Terminal.

```console
sudo reboot
```
