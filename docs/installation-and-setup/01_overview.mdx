This tutorial describes how to install and set up [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org/) on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Desktop (64-bit). You'll focus on using the Bitcoin Cash Node graphical user interface (GUI) so that you can visualize processes on the blockchain and your Bitcoin Cash wallet transactions.

These instructions are intended for those who have basic knowledge of the Ubuntu environment and Linux commands.
